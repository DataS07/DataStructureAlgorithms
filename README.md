Data Structure and Algorithms Specialization on Coursera

Starting from 'Algorithms on Strings', I am using Python to complete the problems. Before that most of the solutions are provided by C++. As of 28th Nov 2016, I am going to finish this specialization from where I stopped over the summer (Week 1 of Algorithms on Strings), stay tuned...

My own problem solutions to the following courses:
* Algorithmic Toolbox
* Data Structures
* Algorithms on Graphs
* Algorithms on Strings
* Advanced Algorithms and Complexity
* Assembling Genomes and Finding Disease-Causing Mutations
